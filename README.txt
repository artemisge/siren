How to run Siren on localhost using XAMPP:

1. Put Siren's project folder into the "htdocs" folder in your XAMPP install directory (e.g C://xampp/htdocs)
2. Go to localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser and import the sql database file (sirendb.sql). You can find the file in the project folder.
3. In your browser type localhost/siren and navigate from the menu until you reach the html folder. Once you click the html folder, the site starts running automatically.
