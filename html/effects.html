					<h3 class="container-title">Plastic waste</h3>
					<p>There are an estimated 13 million metric tons of plastic being disposed of in the ocean each
						year. As a result, fish, sea birds, sea turtles and other marine animals
						are entangled in the debris. When these animals ingest plastic, the waste clogs their stomach,
						causing them to starve to death. About 60% of all seabird species have
						ingested pieces of plastic, and scientists predict the figure will rise to 99% by 2050.Also,
						plastic waste accelerates the growth of pathogens in the ocean. If the
						pathogens come in contact with corals, there is an 89% chance of the corals contracting
						diseases, in comparison to the 4% likelihood for corals that do not. Not to
						mention that plastics do not fully decompose even after hundreds of years. For this reason, some
						of the plastic ingested by the fish and other marine mammals that
						we eat ends up on our tables. We, therefore, end up eating the plastic debris we dumped on the
						oceans.

					<img src="../imgs/oil.jpg" alt="sewage" class="img-responsive floating-image left">
					<h3 class="container-title">Oil spillage</h3>
					<p>Oil spills are incredibly dangerous to marine life and coral reefs. When exposed to oil, adult
						fish may experience reduced growth, enlarged livers,
						changes in heart and respiration rates, fin erosion, and reproduction impairment. Fish eggs and
						larvae can be especially sensitive to lethal and sublethal impacts.
						Moreover, oil floats on water and creates a layer that denies sunlight from penetrating through
						the water.
						In such cases, marine plants die as they cannot make food through photosynthesis, which requires
						sunlight.</p><br>

					<img src="../imgs/acid.jpg" alt="sewage" class="img-responsive floating-image right">
					<h3 class="container-title">Ocean acidification</h3>
					<p>Ocean acidification negatively affects marine life, causing organisms' shells and skeletons made
						from calcium carbonate to dissolve. The more acidic the ocean,
						the faster the shells dissolve. Animals that produce calcium carbonate structures have to spend
						extra energy either repairing their damaged shells or thickening
						them to survive. Using energy for this could impact the animals' abilities to grow and
						reproduce. Animals able to survive and reproduce in more acidic waters are
						likely to become smaller, potentially affecting the food chain that relies on them.

					<img src="../imgs/turtle.jpg" alt="sewage" class="img-responsive floating-image left">
					<h3 class="container-title">Overfishing</h3>
					<p>Overfishing can impact entire ecosystems. It can change the size of fish remaining, as well as
						how they reproduce and the speed at which they mature. When
						too many fish are taken out of the ocean it creates an imbalance that can erode the food web and
						lead to a loss of other important marine life, including vulnerable
						species like sea turtles and corals.</p>
					<p>Decades of destructive fishing has resulted in the precipitous decline of key fish stocks such as
						bluefin tuna and Grand Banks cod, as well as collateral impacts
						to other marine life. Hundreds of thousands of marine mammals, seabirds, and sea turtles are
						captured each year, alongside tens of millions of sharks. Many of these
						species are endangered and protected, while some such as the vaquita, Eastern Pacific
						leatherback turtle, and Maui dolphin are on the brink of extinction.
