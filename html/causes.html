    <h3 class="container-title">Climate change</h3>
    <p>Global warming has resulted in melting of polar ice caps. This means sea levels are increasing and the water is getting warmer. For this reason,
      many species that rely mainly on glaciers for continued existence, are forced to move further north. In consequence, the fish species will reduce
      and so will be the survival of the birds and animals that are dependent and adapted to the glacier habitats.</p>
      <p>Warm waters are also increasing coral bleaching events, causing the coral reefs to shed the zooxanthellae, which gives them their brilliant colors.
      It is important to know that corals support the life and breeding of many marine creatures and if they continue to be affected by climate change
     – highly influenced by greenhouse emissions, they will continue to die.

    <h3 class="container-title">Overfishing</h3>
    <p>Overfishing occurs when more fish are caught than the population can replace through natural reproduction, according to WWF. Due to unrestricted,
      unregulated fishing (UUF), over 75% of the world’s fish have been fully exploited or depleted. The results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans,
      but also the social and economic well-being of the coastal communities who depend on fish for their way of life. Although, it is very difficult to regulate
      fishing areas due to lack of resources and tracking activity. In addition to that, most areas in the world have a total lack of oversight related to their
     fishing industry, which means the activity of fishing fleets is barely even monitored.</p><br><hr><hr>

    <h3 class="container-title">Marine pollution</h3>
    <p>Marine pollution mainly comes from the mainland into the ocean, although it might arise from the oceans themselves, like during oil spills. It originates primarily
       from domestic, commercial, and industrial resources. Organic waste and chemical nutrients end up in our seas and can lead to oxygen depletion, decay of plant life
       and serious decline in the quality of the seawater. Not to mention that many animals are becoming entangled in the floating debris, or mistake it for food and swallow it.

    <img src="../imgs/coral-reef.jpg" alt="sewage" class="img-responsive floating-image left">
    <h3 class="container-title">Ocean Acidification</h3>
    <p>Ocean acidification is the process whereby ocean waters increase in acid concentration, and the pH level falls beyond normal. Mainly it arises due to the release of
       sulfur and nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide from greenhouse gases, which also cause global warming and climate change. As the water becomes more acidic, it loses its
      ability to sustain marine organisms. Some marine creatures lose their ability to form shells and there is an increased chance for disruption in their reproductive processes.
     Thus, a great deal of marine species disappears from the aquatic ecological environment.</p>
